Young men are becoming a disadvantaged group as far more young women go to university, higher education chiefs have warned.The number of girls seeking a university place this year is more than a third larger than that of boys.The growing divide is becoming a more pressing issue than the number of applicants from poorer homes, said the chief executive of Ucas, the universities admissions service. 'There remains a stubborn gap between male and female applicants which, on current trends, could eclipse the gap between rich and poor within a decade, Mary Curnock Cook said.'Young men are becoming a disadvantaged group in terms of going to university and this underperformance needs urgent focus across the education sector.Ucas said that 580,000 people have applied for places at British institutions this year. Around 333,700 of them were women, almost 58 per cent. Only 246,300 men applied, a difference of 87,000, which was up 7,000 on last year. In the 2010-11 academic year, women made up 55 per cent of applicants. The overall number of applications to university was up, but female applications grew by 4 per cent compared with 3 per cent among men.The figures show that an unprecedented 35 per cent of 18-year-olds applied to university this year.The total number was higher than last year but still down on the record set in 2011, the year before tuition fees rose to £9,000 annually.Overall, university applications have increased by almost 4 per cent on last year in spite of a small fall in the population of 18-year-olds, the admissions service said.In many parts of the university sector, male students are now a clear minority at undergraduate level.In at least 20 institutions, there are twice as many female full-time undergraduates as males. The growing divide in further education follows a similar trend at school level, where girls now outperform boys in all age groups and subjects.Last summer's GCSE results showed a record gap, with almost 25 per cent of exams sat by girls graded A* or A, compared with less than 18 per cent among boys.Ucas reported a steady increase in applications from poorer households. Ms Curnock Cook said that there was remarkably persistent growth in demand for higher education from all backgrounds and talked of an encouraging pattern of demand from disadvantaged students.The figures show that the gender gap is particularly wide among poorer households.According to the Sutton Trust, an educational charity, young women from the most disadvantaged communities are much more likely to apply to university than young men.The decision to increase tuition fees to as much as £9,000 a year was one of the most controversial taken by the Coalition, but Vince Cable, the Business Secretary, said: It's clear that young people understand that investing in a degree is an investment for their future.Prof Les Ebdon, the director of fair access to higher education, said that application rates among 18-year-olds from disadvantaged backgrounds are higher than ever, having doubled in a decade.But he added: Young people from the most advantaged areas are still two and a half times more likely to apply for higher education than those from areas where participation is low. This gap hinders efforts to increase social mobility.
